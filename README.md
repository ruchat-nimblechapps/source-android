## Android Bootstrap
A bootstrap Android project which comes with a pre-populated structure for a single app-based project, including the common library, standard dimensions, build and configuration scripts.

### Setup
1. Clone into a new folder
2. Change directory to the new folder
3. Run `./gradlew initialise` adding `codename` and `appname` parameters (ie "fishfigure" and "Fish Figure" respectively) eg. ./gradlew initialise -Pcodename="fishfigure" -Pappname="Fish Figure"
4. Commit code as the initial commit
5. And that should be it!
